## Project Description
PetMatch is a smart pet adoption platform that helps users discover pets, understand them through owner-provided details, and find compatible companions using a quiz-based matching system.

The platform creates a shared adoption space focused on connection, trust, and informed decision-making.

---

## The Problem Statement
Pet adoption platforms often act only as listing boards where adopters cannot properly understand pets before adoption. This causes poor compatibility, lack of trust, and unsuccessful adoptions.

---

## The Solution
PetMatch provides a centralized platform where adopters can browse pets, learn about them directly from owners, and use a compatibility quiz to find suitable matches, making adoption more personal and reliable.
